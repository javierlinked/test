Requirements definition

The idea is that we want a Single Page Application that will allow a user to search and get an image fromUnsplash. In particular our application should make use of the REST API offered by Unsplash. A UI form will allow a user to specify a search term of the desired photo to be found at Unsplash. Optional arguments can be the preferred orientation of the photo or the color based on which photos will be filtered out.

Only one photo should be picked ( randomly ) and then be displayed.

Requirements
● ReactJS should be used.
● Be sure that the appropriate Unsplash endpoint is selected
● Any network issues or not-successful responses from Unsplash should be shown nicely to the user.

Nothing fancy, just an informative message that something went wrong.
A free account at Unsplash is required in order to use its API.

Deliverables
● A compressed folder containing the .git repository
● We should be able to verify the functionality using either npm or yarn start scripts
